## New Beta Resources

*   `AssetFeed`
*   `BigQueryReservationAssignment`
*   `CloudDeployDeliveryPipeline`
*   `ComposerEnvironment`
*   `NetworkSecurityAuthorizationPolicy`
*   `NetworkSecurityClientTlsPolicy`
*   `NetworkSecurityServerTlsPolicy`

## New Fields

*   `ComposerEnvironment`:
    *   Added `spec.config.storageConfig` field.
    *   Added `spec.config.workloadsConfig.dagProcessor` field.
    *   Added `spec.config.workloadsConfig.triggerer` field.
    *   Added `spec.config.softwareConfig.webServerPluginsMode` field.
    *   Added `spec.config.softwareConfig.cloudDataLineageIntegration` field.

## Reconciliation Improvements

*   Introduce Stateful Reconciliation for Direct Controllers. The controller will store a hash of the last successfully applied `.spec` in the resource's `.status`. This provides a lightweight, GitOps-safe historical record, allowing the controller to know with certainty when a user has modified their desired state.

*   Added support for checking etag in spec.
